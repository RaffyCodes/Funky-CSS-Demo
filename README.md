# Funky-CSS-Demo
Experimented with spinning a transparent image and using some colorful CSS gradients and text effects for fun


After working with React more and more, I've been seeing the boilerplate code for 'Create a React App' with the spinning react logo. 

I had the idea to use my own head and do something similar and also use some cool gradients and colors and make it really fun looking.

The idea was fun and I was able to execute my idea quickly with desired effect.
